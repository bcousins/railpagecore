Railpage Core Code
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doctorjbeam/railpagecore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doctorjbeam/railpagecore)

This repository contains the core Railpage PHP objects formerly located under their respective modules. 

Since Version 3.8 the core code has been progressively split from their UI modules and re-located into a PSR-4-compliant folder and file structure. 

The classes have been namespaced under the \Railpage\ namespace, for example: \Railpage\Locos\Locomotive.
