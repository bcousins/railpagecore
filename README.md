This repository contains the core Railpage PHP objects formerly located under their respective modules. 

Since Version 3.8 the core code has been progressively split from their UI modules and re-located into a PSR-4-compliant folder and file structure. 

The classes have been namespaced under the \Railpage\ namespace, for example: \Railpage\Locos\Locomotive.
